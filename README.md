# JavaScript Calculator :1234:

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp's Front End Certification.
It was built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Functionality :white_check_mark:

- I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- In any order, I should be able to add, subtract, multiply and divide a chain of numbers of any length, and when I hit =, the correct result should be shown. ** EXAMPLE: 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 = **
- When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a number to begin with multiple zeros.
- I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on numbers containing decimal points.
- If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered.
- Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.
